## Let's step back in time ...

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gardenR)
library(knitr)
library(here)
here::i_am("README.md")
```

Back before RMarkdown, like when I wrote my PhD thesis, my workflow looked something like this:

1. Write R code in something like notepad - pretty much just plain text.  
2. Save any important output and images to folders that were "organized" by topic.  
3. Make a note in the code file of what I named the images.  
4. Put this all together in a latex or Word document.  
5. Hope that I wouldn't forget what or where everything was.

It WAS NOT fine!  

I somehow put together my thesis in one document, but (don't tell anyone), there's no way I'd be able to put it all back together now!

## Enter RMarkdown

<div class="columns-2">

See tomato_example.Rmd

</div>


<div class="notes">

1. Write code to do analysis in an R Markdown file (includes all code, text, and output in one place) and compile to desired format, usually html.
2. If a change needs to be made, I can easily do that without having to figure out which piece of code created which output.  
3. This has made my life sooooo much easier!! It would be very difficult to going back to doing things the "old way" ... I haven't yet.

This is my garden. I joke that it's my 3rd child in the summers. I'm sure you're wondering, what does Lisa's garden have to do with parameterized reports? 

Well, not only do I harvest fruit and vegetables from it, but I collect data, too!

Every time I go pick some fruit and vegetables, I bring it inside and weight it, enter it into a spreadsheet, and (eventually) update my gardenR R package. 

</div>

## Goal

Create a report for each vegetable that 

- Highlights how its weight compares to other vegetables.  
- Shows weights of different varieties of that vegetable.  
- Graphs cumulative harvest for that vegetable over time. 

Let's look at the report I created for tomatoes: 01_simple_report.html

<div class="notes">
Let's scroll through the code that created the report. I've highlighted all the places the word tomatoes is used in the code. As we see at the end, there are also some places where the word tomato is used. 
</div>


## Now what? ... `params`!

<div class="columns-2">

- I DO NOT want to find and replace all!  
- There are `r length(unique(harvest_2021$vegetable))` unique vegetables. 
- See 02_parameterized_report.Rmd

![](images/yaml_params.png){width="90%"}

</div>

<div class="notes">
Trying to replicate this new report using find and replace would be awful. We could set up a variable at the beginning of the code, which would solve many (although not all) of our probelms, but that won't give us a good way to programatically run the file, which I'll talk about later. 

Instead, we add something new to the YAML header: a parameter. Our parameter is vegetable, and its initial value is "tomatoes".

## Using parameter inside of YAML

What you type in Rmd:

![](images/yaml_title_rmd.png){width="100%"}

What it looks like in knitted file:
![](images/yaml_title_html.png){width="100%"}

## Rmd and html

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mutate(veggie_color = vegetable == params$vegetable)
```

![](images/param_highlight_veg.png){width="100%"}


## Rmd and html

```{r, eval=FALSE}
labs(title = paste0("Total  harvest of each variety (kg), 2021: ", params$vegetable)
```

![](images/param_ggplot_title.png){width="100%"}

## Change the parameter value - in Rmd

</center>


## Change the parameter value - programmatically

See 03_render_reports.R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
render(
  # Point to the Rmd file
  input = here("02_parameterized_report.Rmd"),
  # Name the output file (and path)
  # This code puts it in a folder called sample_render
  output_file = here("sample_render", "lettuce_example.html"),
  # New value of parameter
  params = list(vegetable = "lettuce")
  )
```

## Making a lot of reports

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Vector of all vegetables with more than 2 harvests
vegetable <- harvest_2021 %>% 
  group_by(vegetable) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n > 2) %>% 
  pull(vegetable)

# tibble that has the input Rmd, output file path, 
# and params written correctly as a list. 
reports <- tibble(
  input = here("02_parameterized_report.Rmd"),
  output_file = here("output", paste0(vegetable, "-report.html")),
  params = map(vegetable, ~list(vegetable = .))
)

# creates all the reports!
reports %>% 
  pwalk(render)
```
