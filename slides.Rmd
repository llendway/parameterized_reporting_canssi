## Let's step back in time ...

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gardenR)
library(knitr)
library(here)
here::i_am("README.md")
```

Back before RMarkdown, like when I wrote my PhD thesis, my workflow looked something like this:

1. Write R code in something like notepad - pretty much just plain text.  
2. Save any important output and images to folders that were "organized" by topic.  
3. Make a note in the code file of what I named the images.  
4. Put this all together in a latex or Word document.  
5. Hope that I wouldn't forget what or where everything was.

It WAS NOT fine!  

I somehow put together my thesis in one document, but (don't tell anyone), there's no way I'd be able to put it all back together now!

## Enter RMarkdown

<div class="columns-2">

<div class="notes">

1. Write code to do analysis in an R Markdown file (includes all code, text, and output in one place) and compile to desired format, usually html.
2. If a change needs to be made, I can easily do that without having to figure out which piece of code created which output.  
3. This has made my life sooooo much easier!! It would be very difficult to going back to doing things the "old way" ... I haven't yet.

This is my garden. I joke that it's my 3rd child in the summers. I'm sure you're wondering, what does Lisa's garden have to do with parameterized reports? 

Well, not only do I harvest fruit and vegetables from it, but I collect data, too!

Sooooo .... 

</div>

## Goal

Create a report for each vegetable that 

- Highlights how its weight compares to other vegetables.  
- Shows weights of different varieties of that vegetable.  
- Graphs cumulative harvest for that vegetable over time. 

Let's look at the report I created for tomatoes: 01_simple_report.html

Let's say I want to create a report for each vegetable that

Let's look at the report I created for tomatoes: 01_simple_report.html

We have all the features in the report we desired.

  <source src="images/tomatoes.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

</center>

<div class="notes">
Now, let's scroll through the code that created the report. I've highlighted all the places the word "tomatoes" is used in the code. If I want to create the same report for a different vegetable, I certainly don't want to have to manually do it! 
</div>


## Now what? ... `params`!

See 02_parameterized_report.Rmd for code and the .html file for the report.

![](images/yaml_params.png){width="90%"}


<div class="notes">
Trying to replicate this new report using find and replace would be awful. We could set up a variable at the beginning of the code, which would solve many (although not all) of our probelms, but that won't give us a good way to programatically run the file, which I'll talk about later. 

Instead, we add something new to the YAML header: a parameter. Our parameter is vegetable, and its initial value is "tomatoes". 
</div>

<div class="notes">
Once I run a section of code, the parameter is accessible via params, dollar sign, name of parameter. So, `params$vegetable`, which in this case results in "tomatoes". I can then use `params$vegetable` throughout the code. I will point out a few examples.

- Here I use it to create a variable that will be used to color the tomatoes differently in a bar graph and in a table.  
- Here I use it to add the word tomatoes to the section header.  
- Here I use it to put the word tomatoes in a ggplot title.

Here are a few examples of what those look like when the file is knitted. Here's the title in the YAML section.

  ggplot(
    aes(x = total_weight_kg,

        fill = veggie_color)

<div class="notes">
I can go into the rmd file and manually change the param to the value I want to create the new report. Or ....
</div>

## Change the parameter value - programmatically

See 03_render_reports.R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
render(
  # Point to the Rmd file
  input = here("02_parameterized_report.Rmd"),
  # Name the output file (and path)
  # This code puts it in a folder called sample_render
  output_file = here("sample_render", "lettuce_example.html"),
  # New value of parameter
  params = list(vegetable = "lettuce")
  )
```

<div class="notes">
I can use the `render()` function to change it programatically!
</div>

## Making a lot of reports

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Vector of all vegetables with more than 2 harvests
vegetable <- harvest_2021 %>% 
  group_by(vegetable) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  filter(n > 2) %>% 
  pull(vegetable)

# tibble that has the input Rmd, output file path, 
# and params written correctly as a list. 
reports <- tibble(
  input = here("02_parameterized_report.Rmd"),
  output_file = here("output", paste0(vegetable, "-report.html")),
  params = map(vegetable, ~list(vegetable = .))
)

# creates all the reports!
reports %>% 
  pwalk(render)
```

<div class="notes">
This gives me the opportunity to write some more complex code that will create all the reports I want, with very little work on my end.
